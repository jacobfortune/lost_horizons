# lost_horizons
This is just a little texture pack. This is a little thing I made for my own smp. It is called Lost Horizons. It changes the minecraft font and the music disc songs to some of my friends. You probably won't use this but if you like some of these songs, feel free to use!
This will change the Minecraft font to Lost Horizons, implement fieryabyss' elytra styling. The music file implement different songs, like Risk it All, Alan Walker songs, some NCS, some Black Parade MCR, Aloura and two much Grian.
